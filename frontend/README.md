# Seed Quickstart

**To get started:**

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart.git`

- If you don't have Rust and cargo-make installed, [Download it](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and run the following commands:

`rustup update`

`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

`cargo install cargo-make`

Run `cargo make build` in a terminal to build the app, and `cargo make serve` to start a dev server
on `127.0.0.1:8000`.

If you'd like the compiler automatically check for changes, recompiling as
needed, run `cargo make watch` instead of `cargo make build`.

**Deploy**

1. Run `cargo make build release`
2. Upload `index.html` and `pkg` to your web server
